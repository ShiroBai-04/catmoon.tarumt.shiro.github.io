            <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The Catmoon Story</h1>
            <p>Our story began in 2004. Back then we were a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground coffee, tea and spices with a single store in Kuala Lumpur. 
                Today, we are privileged to connect with millions of customers every day in 76 markets.</p>
            <p>Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first 
                CatMoon opened in 2020 and it’s just as true today.</p>
            <p>Back then, the company was a single store in Kuala Lumpur. From just a narrow storefront, CatMoon offered some of the world’s 
                finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Chi Ban, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>
            <p>In 2021, Qi Yuan (CatMoon chairman emeritus) first walked into a CatMoon store. From his first cup of Sarawak, Howard was drawn into CatMoon and joined a year later.</p>
            <p>The following year, in 2022, Qi Yuan traveled to Japan and became captivated with Japan coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the 
                Japan coffeehouse tradition back to the Malaysia. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left CatMoon for a short 
                period of time to start his own coffeehouses and returned in August 2022 to purchase CatMoon with the help of local investors.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, CatMoon set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.</p>
